This is the cookbook of the tidy data set of the Getting and Cleaning data coursera final project.

Features:
=========

Subject.Id: contains the id of the subject that carried out the activity that is measured
Activity: Type of activity perform by the subject.

The following signals represent the measurements that were done during the activity. Those are time-domain signals (prefix 't'). Some signals were measured on each axis (-XYZ) giving three different signals (e.g tBodyAcc-X, tBodyAcc-Y, tBodyAcc-Z).
tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag


The following were computed from the time-domain signals mentioned above using a Fast Fourier Transform. To each signal measured on each axis correspond a frequency on that same axis (e.g. fBodyAcc-X, fBodyAcc-Y, fBodyAcc-Z).
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

Those measurement are transformed into variables in the data set using statistical function. For each measurement there is:
 - a standard deviation of the measurement (std)
 - an average of the measurement (mean)

Example: for tBodyAcc-XYZ those are the variables in the data set: 
 - tBodyAcc.mean-X
 - tBodyAcc.std-X
 - tBodyAcc.mean-Y
 - tBodyAcc.std-Y
 - tBodyAcc.mean-Z
 - tBodyAcc.std-Z
